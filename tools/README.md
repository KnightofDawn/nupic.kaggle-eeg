Tools that may be helpful:  

`dataExaminer.py`: makes (sorta) pretty charts from the data. Arguments as follows:  

```
dataExaminer.py textfile electrode
```

`dataToCsv.py`: turns it into a csv. Arguments as follows: 

```
dataToCsv.py datafile csvfile
```

In both cases, the code is pretty simple.  Both scripts writes the data's numpy header information to `stdout`.
