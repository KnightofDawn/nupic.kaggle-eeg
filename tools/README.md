Tools that may be helpful:  

dataExaminer.py makes (sorta) pretty charts from the data.  arguments as follows:  dataExaminer.py textfile electrode

dataToCsv.py turns it into a csv.  arguments as follows:  dataToCsv.py datafile csvfile

In both cases, the code is pretty simple.  Both scripts writes the data's numpy header information to stdout.
